# Wordpress


I created a site using WordPress with one of their free themes, you can visit this abhorrent site by [clicking here](https://wp.me/Pebcau-2)

## My preconceived thoughts about WordPress

- It's great to get something done quick
- It's free
- Some [huge businesses](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/40-most-notable-big-name-brands-that-are-using-wordpress/) are built on the back of it
- It's really easy to learn & use

## My thoughts reconsidered

- The browser interface is unintuitive, everything you do opens up a new tab & it's extremely easy to get lost
- It's not free really
- ...
- In a few hours I have a page - I'm not entirely aware of HOW
